# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a welcoming environment, we as members of the Postfurry social communities (MUCK, Discord Server, etc) pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience regardless of body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Users of our chat servers must:
 * Be at least 18 years of age.
 * Maintain an open and empathetic attitude toward others in the group.

Examples of unacceptable public behavior by participants include:
 * Explicit content in rooms marked for general audiences (e.g. #general on Discord)
 * Explicit content where characters/actors are not the age of majority.
 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
 * Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
 * Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, or any other social account contact info, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of “outing” of any aspect of someone’s identity without their consent.
 * Publishing screenshots or quotes without all quoted users’ explicit consent.
 * Publishing of non-harassing private communication.
 * Any of the above even when presented as “ironic” or “joking”.
 * Any attempt to present “reverse-ism” versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are “reverse racism”, “reverse sexism”, “heterophobia”, and “cisphobia”.

Examples of discouraged behavior by participants include:
 * Explicit content involving violence and/or gore.
 * Feigning or exaggerating surprise when someone admits to not knowing
   something.
 * “Well-actuallies”

### An Edge-Case: Gender Terminology
Participants might use words like "cuntboy", "dickgirl", "shemale", "hermaphrodite", etc, to describe their own body types or how they self-identify. While we understand these words can and have been used as slurs, we also recognize the power in reclaiming language for personal self-expression, especially in cases where no other terms exist. As such, this sort of terminology can be acceptable, discouraged, or unacceptable, depending on context:

 * These terms are considered explicit usage, and thus should be kept out of general chatrooms (and, by extension, usernames)
 * Using these terms to refer to yourself is acceptable. Using them to refer to any individual or character who is not known to use them to refer to themself is not acceptable, and is considered slur usage.
 * Expressing a personal dispreference to these these terms is also acceptable. Using these terms heavily around someone who has specifically expressed this is discouraged. Not everyone feels the same about terminology reclamation, and we seek to be respectful of people with differing perspectives.

## Our Responsibilities

Community admins are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Admins have the right and responsibility to remove any messages, channels, images, or other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any member or participant for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Admins are reachable in the following ways:
* Discord: Admin names are highlighted in blue.
* MUCK: Use the `staff` command.

## Scope

Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

## Enforcement

The Admin team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.

Please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community’s leadership.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4], and the WeAllJS Slack Code of Conduct.
