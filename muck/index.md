# Postfurry MUCK

Postfurry MUCK is a text-based environment built to encourage roleplay, identity exploration, and worldbuilding. Join us in the Puzzlebox, a vast posthuman megastructure filled with environments that are cozy, rowdy, mind-bending, or sometimes all of the above, all at once!

In the Puzzlebox, you can find:
* The [scattered shards of six Messy neighborhoods](https://wiki.postfurry.net/wiki/Mess_of_Warps) where different factions wage conflict through art and narrative
* A [theme-park solar system](https://wiki.postfurry.net/wiki/12Fold_Resorts) where each planet is a different kink playground
* A [sprawling city](https://wiki.postfurry.net/wiki/Oneiropolis) where it’s always night and dream-logic holds sway

…and many other things, including whatever you want to build yourself!

In the Puzzlebox, you can be:

* An inquisitive explorer seeking to find something long-lost in the Fractured Warps
* A hopeful immigrant seeking a new place to live that fits your deepest-held desires
* A content inhabitant of your own personal utopia, interested in sharing it with others

…or your existing character from another world, sucked in by the power of the Neon Aurora!

In the transhuman reality of the Puzzlebox, the rules of text RP are laws of physics. You can create anything if you can imagine it well enough, nothing can happen to you without your consent, and your bodily form is limited only by your creativity. We’re committed to creating a space together where postfurries and others can interact, explore, and build wonders together.
