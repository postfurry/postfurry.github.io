<h1>Request a Character</h1>

<p>Character creation is a lightly-moderated manual process. We're not setting a high bar to clear, but we want to know that you're here in good faith, and ready to follow <a href="
/conduct">the Code of Conduct.</a> Also, bear in mind that the main purposes of the MUCK itself are roleplay and worldbuilding; if you're interested in more casual chat, we invite you to <a href="http://discord.postfurry.net/" target="_blank">the Postfurry Embassy Discord server</a>. In fact, we recommend you be on both, since the Discord server is the main place for up-to-date information outside the MUCK server itself.</p>

<p>You can expect a response to your submission within 2 days; if you don't, drop us a line using the <a href="/contact">contact us form</a>.</p>
