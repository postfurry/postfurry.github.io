OOC Note: In the interest of getting RP going but not leaving anyone left out, we'll occasionally be posting brief summaries here of the goings-on that might affect the wider MUCK world, or those that might just be of interest to folks. If you'd like yours included, just let the staff know, via the usual channels!

Thanks to this RP, we've also added a new area to the MUCK, and I have some quick thoughts about RP on the MUCK, at the end of the post. Even if you're not interested in the RP summary, please consider reading [that bit](#downwarp-area-info).  Thanks!

It's hard to pin down where it all came from. The narratives braid together and double-back, and causes follow effects. It's a known side effect of the machinery, of course, reverse echoes of future events, drawing individuals together. Nikolai was fretting about unfinished business, Indi was having dreams of vis ancestors, and in another place, folks were getting quite worried for the integrity of their home.

One result was clear, though. Nikolai was tinkering in an Oneiropolis alley, trying to use an old invention to find his way back to his previous home. Indi and Elluim sought Nik out, the coyotter intending to ask him about something ve thought was unrelated. Nik cheerfully 'allowed' them to help in the experiment, also drawing in another passerby (Darash). And before they all knew what was happening, a literal bolt of lightning carried them up and out of the city, and back into another very different one.

Nikolai recognized his old home of Downwarp instantly, though it had clearly seen better days (even by Downwarp standards).  A lightning bolt stood at the other end as well, but this one was weak and faltering, which dismayed the otter quite a bit for reasons he wasn't sharing with everyone else. He had a welcoming party too, a pair of Gridshamans, a blue dragonoid (Groove-Weld) and a glowing coyote golem who bore a definite resemblance to Indi (Arc-Light)

Nik at least recognized Arc, and vice versa, the coyote happily welcoming the otter back. Months had passed there, in contrast to the years that Nik had spent elsewhere, but quite a bit had changed; some of the services that Downwarp was used to had stopped working, as if the greater intelligence that used to watch over it had somehow lost interest. Arc also recognized Indi, and vice versa, some sort of filial relationship that both golems had a hard time explaining.

Nik revealed that with the equipment at this end in such a state of disrepair, they'd have a hard time getting back. The others took this well enough, exploring the strange new city, and delving into the local culture and attractions. Elluim found a new glowy waterpark, and Indi immersed verself in study of the mystic traditions that ve'd only dreamed about vague before.  Nik, meanwhile, did Science.

It was a couple weeks before Nik gathered the others together again, ready to open the bridge home. This required a combination of his own technology, and the 'local semiotics' of the Gridshamans, to re-energize the bolt and let it find its way back. And so it did, though Nik seemed only half intent on that as his goal, paying quite a bit of his own attention to some other goal that he was reluctant to explain. But the bolt blazed bright, the bridge found its way back, and a permanent link was established between Downwarp and the Oneiropolis, a new Lightning Tree lighting the night in each city.

Downwarp has been added as a new area. We're hoping Downwarp will be an area where RP is more strongly encouraged. We want to keep the vibe of a free mix of RP and casual socializing, but I figured it might be worth a try to have a slightly more plotty area for people to head to if interested. You can get to the entry area using 't downwarp'. Have fun!

And I'd just like to say again, since I don't think it can ever be said enough: Whether or not you're interesteed in RPing, or think you're 'good enough' to join us in anything, we want to see you around! We do far more friendly socializing and play than any sort of RP, and even the RP isn't expected to be high art. If you are friendly and supportive and empathetic, you have a place with us. So don't be afraid to sign up, or show up if you've already signed up. We'd love to see you!
