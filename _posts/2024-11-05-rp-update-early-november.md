Time for another RP update! Our gathering sessions at 2PM Pacific time on Saturdays are still going strong! 

## What's gone before
* A silent apparition appeared to folks in Poly Park, leaving some odd books behind.
* Park regulars determined they were from the library in Strangewarp, and started to explore the connected realms to find a way to return them
* They eventually found the entrance to the Library in an underpass in Oneiropolis
* There they found an eerie-but-benign enclave of Strangewarp, and the Librarian who had been leaving the books around to try to lead folks there.
* In Library Strange, there was a new colorful dog. This one is green!

## What's going on now
* Attempts to find a way out of Library Strange to discover what's become of the rest of Strangewarp
* The Orion, a ship full of former Bottomwarpers, is pulling into Park-local space to re-establish contact with the rest of the Puzzlebox, and to seek hints on the location of their lost home-warp
