Hello there! Long time no talk! We've had something stirring for a _while_ now, and it’s finally time to make it official:

We’re relaunching PostfurryMUCK with a new theme: The Puzzlebox!

You may have heard rumors of it, a Messy place, or six Warpy realms, all tangled up together, each one a utopia to some folk, all of them set up for posthuman exploration and creativity. The rumors say the whole thing fell apart—maybe even exploded—ages ago, and yet…

The Puzzlebox is bigger than those places. The Puzzlebox has room for anything you can imagine. And now, the Puzzlebox is open to you, to build anew, to change as you see fit, or even to explore in search of the lost shards of those Warps.

PostfurryMUCK is a text-based environment for roleplay and self-expression. We will have weekly gatherings starting _this Saturday_, Septemver 28, at 2PM Pacific time, but you’re welcome to join us at any time.

If you don't have a character on the MUCK, [here's the place to go](https://postfurry.net/muck/request/), and if you want to find out more about this new world in the making, check out [all the lore on the Postfurry Wiki](https://wiki.postfurry.net/wiki/Postfurry_MUCK).

We hope to see you there!
