It's been a bit long in coming because of meatspace holidays, but it's time for an RP update! Reminder that our gathering sessions are 2PM Pacific time on Saturdays.

## What’s happened recently (Background that’s helpful to know about)

* The Orion, a starship full of Bottomwarp refugees searching for their home, has arrived in local space. The Puzzlebox recognized it as part of Bottomwarp itself, leading the inhabitants to be very hopeful they’ll find the rest of their warp soon.
* When three colorful canids from three different warp fragments gathered together, they developed enough of a shared mind to start speaking, and are eagerly seeking out the other shards that might hold the rest of their pack.
* A piece of Charmwarp was found in the Oneiropolis mall, and a lost creature emerged from it, seeking… something.

## What’s going on now (RP hooks for you to join in on)
* More and more folk are emerging from disconnected places, looking for hints to their lost homes. Have you seen anything strange that might help them? What will happen when even more shattered and strange places get reconnected together?
* The cosmic seasonal cycles are sweeping across the Puzzlebox, bringing times that can be uncertain and dim. Different cultures have their own ways of pushing back, helping the cycle go around again: bright lights, cheerful songs, big feast. Gatherings in celebration of Glowtide have already begun. How do you celebrate? 
* However you celebrate, there will be some MUCK-wide Glowtide events in mid-January, connecting farflung points of the worlds in community and light!
