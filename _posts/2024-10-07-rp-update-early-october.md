As roleplay picks back up on PostfurryMUCK, we'll be posting occasional updates here to give an idea of what all is going on. These will come out irregularly, as there are developments, but most likely no more than a couple times a month.

## What’s gone before
- Recently, a neon aurora appeared in the sky above the Puzzlebox and several other disparate realms, disrupting transportation in the former and royally befuddling folks in the latter.
- In most places, its appearance faded after a few days, but it left some sort of connection behind.
- As the Puzzlebox repaired its magic-mirror transit network, it also sent out mirrorprobes to the other locales that the aurora had touched.
- Inhabitants of those places found themselves connected up to the Puzzlebox, via a place called the Transit Nexus, under the aurora-lit Poly Park.
- Other folks have found themselves pulled out of their own worlds more directly, left to try to make a new home for themselves among the places the Nexus links to.
- Poly Park has become a gathering for denizens new and old alike. Some are looking for a new home, others are trying to find their way back to places once thought lost.

## What’s going on now
- Inhabitants of Downwarp, one of the places thought lost in the fracturing of the Mess, have managed to connect the place back up to the Transit Nexus. 
- There are plenty of rumors and speculation about other Warps still being out there, but no mirror-links have been established with them.
- The Orion, a starship filled with nomadic former Bottomwarpers, has arrived in the vicinity of the aurora, in search of clues that will lead them back to their lost home.
- A book was left in Poly Park by an oddly abstract creature, who came and went via a door that wasn't there.
