We've been hard at work polishing up our various resources and discussion areas, and we have a bunch of cool new stuff to announce!

* First, we have a beta version of a [Web Client](https://muck.postfurry.net) for Postfurry MUCK, which should help folks who want to connect there but have had trouble setting up a desktop client. You will still need to [request a character](/muck/request) to get online there.
* Next, we now also have a [Postfurry Embassy Telegram Group](https://t.me/postfurryembassy), for those who are interested in something else like the Discord Server, but without Discord.
* Finally, the Discord server itself has been revamped a bit with better organization and new rooms, and the invite link has changed. If you're already there, you should be good to go, but if you'd like to join the fun, [use this link](https://discord.gg/Sc8cQsN)
