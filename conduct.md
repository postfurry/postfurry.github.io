# Postfurry Worlds Code of Conduct

## When Something Happens

If you see a Code of Conduct violation, follow these steps:

1. Let the person know that what they did is not appropriate and ask them to stop and/or edit their message(s).
2. That person should immediately stop the behavior and correct the issue.
3. If this doesn’t happen, or if you're uncomfortable speaking up, [contact admins](#contacting-admins).
4. As soon as available, an admin will identify themselves, and take [further action (see below)](#further-enforcement), starting with a warning, then temporary deactivation, then long-term deactivation.

When reporting, please include any relevant details, links, screenshots, context, or other information that may be used to better understand and resolve the situation.

**The Admin team will prioritize the well-being and comfort of the recipients of the violation over the comfort of the violator.** See
[some examples below](#enforcement-examples).

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering a welcoming environment, we as members of the Postfurry Worlds communities (MUCK, Discord Server, etc) pledge to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience regardless of body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We aim to provide space for exploration and discussion of topics that can be highly sensitive, personal, adult, or some combination of all of the above. Discussion and sharing of adult content is permitted by default on our servers. Therefore, all users of the servers **must be at least 18 years of age**.

In order to keep true to our pledge and keep our spaces welcoming and productive for all, we've defined some standards of conduct, positive and negative, that users can use as examples of what to do more of, and when to possibly involve an admin.

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

  * Using welcoming and inclusive language.
  * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
  * Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
  * Focusing on what is best for the community.
  * Showing empathy and kindness towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable public behavior by participants include:

 * Explicit content in rooms marked for general audiences (e.g. #general on Discord)
 * Explicit content where characters/actors are not the age of majority.
 * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
 * Public or private harassment, deliberate intimidation, or threats.
 * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, or any other social account contact info, without explicit permission. This includes any sort of "outing" of any aspect of someone's identity without their consent.
 * Publishing screenshots or quotes without all quoted users' explicit consent.
 * Publishing of non-harassing private communication.
 * Any of the above even when [presented as "ironic" or "joking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_racism).
 * Any attempt to present "reverse-ism" versions of the above as violations. Examples of reverse-isms are "reverse racism", "reverse sexism", "heterophobia", and "cisphobia".

We also recognize sorts of behavior that may not always rise to the level of violation or admin action, but still should be avoided in most situtations as a matter of course. Examples of such discouraged behavior by participants include:

 * Explicit content involving violence and/or gore, without a content warning.
 * Flashing/startling images, without a content warning.
 * Unsolicited explanations under the assumption that someone doesn't already know it. Ask before you teach! Don't assume what people's knowledge gaps are.
 * [Feigning or exaggerating surprise](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-feigned-surprise)
   when someone admits to not knowing something.
 * "[Well-actuallies](https://www.recurse.com/manual#no-well-actuallys)"

### An Edge-Case: Gender Terminology

Participants might use words like "cuntboy", "dickgirl", "shemale", "hermaphrodite", etc, to describe their own body types or how they self-identify. While we understand these words can and have been used as slurs, we also recognize the power in reclaiming language for personal self-expression, especially in cases where no other terms exist. As such, this sort of terminology can be acceptable, discouraged, or unacceptable, depending on context:

 * These terms are considered explicit usage, and thus should be kept out of general chatrooms (and, by extension, usernames)
 * Using these terms to refer to yourself is acceptable. Using them to refer to any individual or character who is not known to use them to refer to themself is not acceptable, and is considered slur usage.
 * Expressing a personal dispreference to these these terms is also acceptable. Using these terms heavily around someone who has specifically expressed this is discouraged. Not everyone feels the same about terminology reclamation, and we seek to be respectful of people with differing perspectives.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within community spaces and in other spaces involving the community. This includes the Postfurry Discord Server, MUCK, Twitter community, private email communications in the context of the community, and any events where members of the community are participating, as well as adjacent communities and venues affecting the community’s members.

Depending on the violation, the admins may decide that violations of this code of conduct that have happened outside of the scope of the community may deem an individual unwelcome, and take appropriate action to maintain the comfort and safety of its members.

## Admin Enforcement Process

Once the admins get involved, they will follow a documented series of steps and do their best to preserve the well-being of Postfurry World members.

### Contacting Admins

You may contact Postfurry Worlds admins through any of the following methods:

  * Directly message any admin in private, using the method appropriate to the server (DM on Discord, `page` on the MUCK, etc)
  * Use the `@Administrator` role shortcut in the `#meta` channel on the Discord server.
  * Direct Message [@PostfurryWorlds](https://twitter.com/postfurryworlds) on Twitter with the details and any relevant links.

Admin identities are visible in the following ways:

  * Discord: Admins have the `Administrator` role, and are highlighted in blue in the user list.
  * MUCK: Admins are listed under the `staff` and `wizards` commands.

### Further Enforcement

If you've already followed the [initial enforcement steps](#when-something-happens), these are the steps admins will take for further enforcement, as needed:

  1. Repeat the request to stop.
  2. If the person doubles down, they will be given an official warning.
  3. If the behavior continues or is repeated later, the person will be deactivated for 24 hours.
  4. If the behavior continues or is repeated after the temporary deactivation, a long-term (6-12mo) deactivation will be used.

On top of this, admins may remove any offending messages, images, contributions, etc, as they deem necessary.

Admins reserve full rights to skip any of these steps, at their discretion, if the violation is considered to be a serious and/or immediate threat to the health and well-being of members of the community. These include any threats, serious physical or verbal attacks, and other such behavior that would be completely unacceptable in any social setting that puts our members at risk.

### Who Watches the Watchers?

Admins and other leaders who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the community's leadership. These may include anything from removal from the admin team to a permanent ban from the community.

### Enforcement Examples

*TODO: Rewrite these with more realistic examples for this community.*

#### The Best Case

The vast majority of situations work out like this, in our experience. This interaction is common, and generally positive.

<blockquote>
  <p>Alex: "Yeah I used X and it was really crazy!"</p>
  <p>Patt: "Hey, could you not use that word? What about 'ridiculous' instead?"</p>
  <p>Alex: "oh sorry, sure." -> edits old message to say "it was really confusing!"</p>
</blockquote>

#### The Admin Case

Sometimes, though, you need to get admins involved. Admins will do their best to resolve conflicts, but people who were harmed by something **will take priority**.

<blockquote>
  <p>Patt: "Honestly, sometimes I just really hate using $library and anyone who uses it probably sucks at their job."</p>
  <p>Alex: "Whoa there, could you dial it back a bit? There's a CoC thing about attacking folks' tech use like that."</p>
  <p>Patt: "I'm not attacking anyone, are you deaf?"
  </p><p>Alex: "/msg MxAdmin1 hey uh. Can someone look at what Alex is saying in #general? Patt is getting a bit aggro. I tried to nudge them about it, but nope."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "Hey Patt, admin here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this space."</p>
  <p>Patt: "Leave me alone I haven't said anything bad wtf is wrong with you."
  </p><p>MxAdmin1: "/msg @patt I mean it. Please refer to the CoC over at  postfurry.net/conduct if you have questions, but you can consider this  an actual warning. I'd appreciate it if you reworded your messages in #general, since they made folks there uncomfortable. Let's try and be kind, yeah?"
  </p>
  <p>Patt: "/msg @mxadmin1 Okay sorry. I'm just frustrated and I'm kinda burnt out and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Alex a note apologizing and edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "/msg @patt Thanks for that. I hear you on the stress. Burnout sucks :/.  Have a good one!"</p>
</blockquote>

#### The Nope Case

<blockquote>
  <p>PepeTheFrog🐸: "Hi, I am a literal actual nazi and I think white supremacists are quite fashionable."</p>
  <p>Patt: "NOOOOPE. OH NOPE NOPE."</p>
  <p>Alex: "JFC NO. NOPE."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "👀 Nope. NOPE NOPE NOPE. 🔥"</p>
  <p>PepeTheFrog🐸 has been banned.</p>
</blockquote>
