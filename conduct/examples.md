# Enforcement Examples

## The Best Case

The vast majority of situations work out like this, in our experience. This interaction is common, and generally positive.

<blockquote>
  <p>Alex: "Hey Patt, that new art of your c-boy character is really cute!"</p>
  <p>Patt: "Um, I don't really like to use that term for my chars, can you just say 'transmasculine' or something?"</p>
  <p>Alex: "oh sorry, sure." &rarr; <em>edits old message to "your lion boy chararacter"</em></p>
</blockquote>

## The Admin Case

Sometimes, though, you need to get admins involved. Admins will do their best to resolve conflicts, but people who were harmed by something **will take priority**.

<blockquote>
  <p>Patt: "All those folks into [insert kink here] are making us look really bad, what is wrong with those freaks?"</p>
  <p>Alex: "Whoa there, could you dial it back a bit? There's a CoC thing about attacking folks like that."</p>
  <p>Patt: "I'm not attacking anyone, are you deaf?"</p>
  <p>Alex: <em>/msg MxAdmin1 hey uh. Can someone look at #explicit? Patt is getting a bit aggro. I tried to nudge them about it, but nope.</em></p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "Hey Patt, admin here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this space."</p>
  <p>Patt: "Leave me alone I haven't said anything bad wtf is wrong with you."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: <em>/msg @patt I mean it. Please refer to the CoC over at postfurry.net/conduct if you have questions, but you can consider this  an actual warning. I'd appreciate it if you reworded your messages in #explicit, since they made folks there uncomfortable. Let's try and be kind, yeah?</em>
  </p>
  <p>Patt: <em>/msg @mxadmin1 Okay sorry. I just had a really bad day and I'm frustrated and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Alex a note apologizing and edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble.</em></p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: <em>/msg @patt Thanks for that. Bad days suck. :/ I hope things get better for you!</em></p>
</blockquote>

## The Nope Case

<blockquote>
  <p>KekFrog: "Hi, I am a literal actual nazi and I think white supremacists are quite fashionable."</p>
  <p>Patt: "NOOOOPE. OH NOPE NOPE."</p>
  <p>Alex: "JFC NO. NOPE."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: **peeks in** "Nope. NOPE NOPE NOPE. &gt;:|"</p>
  <p>KekFrog has been banned.</p>
