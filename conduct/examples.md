# Enforcement Examples

## The Best Case

The vast majority of situations work out like this, in our experience. This interaction is common, and generally positive.

<blockquote>
  <p>Alex: "Hey Patt, that new art of your c-boy character is really cute!"</p>
  <p>Patt: "Um, I don't really like to use that term for my chars, can you just say 'transmasculine' or something?"</p>
  <p>Alex: "oh sorry, sure." &rarr; edits old message to "your lion boy chararacter"</p>
</blockquote>

## The Admin Case

Sometimes, though, you need to get admins involved. Admins will do their best to resolve conflicts, but people who were harmed by something **will take priority**.

<blockquote>
  <p>Patt: "All those folks into [insert kink here] are making us look really bad, what is wrong with those freaks?"</p>
  <p>Alex: "Whoa there, could you dial it back a bit? There's a CoC thing about attacking folks like that."</p>
  <p>Patt: "I'm not attacking anyone, are you deaf?"</p>
  <p>Alex: "/msg MxAdmin1 hey uh. Can someone look at #explicit? Patt is getting a bit aggro. I tried to nudge them about it, but nope."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "Hey Patt, admin here. Could you tone it down? This sort of attack is really not okay in this space."</p>
  <p>Patt: "Leave me alone I haven't said anything bad wtf is wrong with you."
  </p><p>MxAdmin1: "/msg @patt I mean it. Please refer to the CoC over at postfurry.net/conduct if you have questions, but you can consider this  an actual warning. I'd appreciate it if you reworded your messages in #explicit, since they made folks there uncomfortable. Let's try and be kind, yeah?"
  </p>
  <p>Patt: "/msg @mxadmin1 Okay sorry. I'm just frustrated and I'm kinda burnt out and I guess I got carried away. I'll DM Alex a note apologizing and edit my messages. Sorry for the trouble."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "/msg @patt Thanks for that. I hear you on the stress. Burnout sucks :/.  Have a good one!"</p>
</blockquote>

## The Nope Case

<blockquote>
  <p>PepeTheFrogüê∏: "Hi, I am a literal actual nazi and I think white supremacists are quite fashionable."</p>
  <p>Patt: "NOOOOPE. OH NOPE NOPE."</p>
  <p>Alex: "JFC NO. NOPE."</p>
  <p>MxAdmin1: "üëÄ Nope. NOPE NOPE NOPE. üî•"</p>
  <p>PepeTheFrogüê∏ has been banned.</p>
